# Branching Convention

We follow the below branching convention

1. Main Branch (main):

    The main branch represents the production-ready code.
    Directly reflects the code currently in production.

2. Feature Branches:

    Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix.
    Naming convention: feature/{feature-name} or bugfix/{bug-description}.
    Branch off from the main branch.
    Once the feature is complete, merge it back into the main branch.

# Commit Convention

each commit needs to be descriptive of the changes and should follow the following convention 

`{label}: descriptive message`

where `{label}` can be `feat` , `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, or  `refactor`
